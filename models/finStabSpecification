A ship at sea is subject to strong environmental stresses. Among these, rolling is the most detrimental, as it can cause difficulties for the ship to maintain its course, create discomfort for the crew and passengers, damage the cargo due to violent roll/righting movements, and even in extreme cases lead to capsizing. The system we aim to design is intended for roll compensation. It is an active fin stabilizer. Deployable fins are located in pairs on both sides of the hull. The movement of these fins is controlled by actuators, managed by a controller. This controller develops commands based on data received from a gyrometer and an inclinometer, which enable it to detect the ship's rolling movements and heeling. It also generates commands for the retraction and deployment of the fins. For this purpose, the system is equipped with a control console that allows the user to command the retraction or deployment of the fins.
